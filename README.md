### Bonus Questions
1. Create a table with the columns customer_id, order_date, product_name, and price. Add a new column called member. The value of member should be 'N' if the order took place before a customer became a member and 'Y' if the order took place after the customer became a member.
2. Take the table you created in Bonus Question # 1. Add a new column called ranking. The value of ranking should be null if the order took place before a customer became a member. If the order took place after the customer became a member, then add a rank to each order. For example, the first order that took place after a customer became a member should be 1. If two orders took place on the same day, they should have the same ranking.
